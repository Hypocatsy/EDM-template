EDM template for EYE

Instructions:
1. Upload EDM design to https://imgur.com/upload
  - click on the menu beside 'Copy Link' and click on 'Get share links'
  - Copy the imgur <b>direct link</b> like `https://i.imgur.com/something.jpg`
  
2. Insert the imgur link in <img> tag like `<img src ="https://i.imgur.com/something.jpg"><img>`

3. Add event link to the <a> tag like `<a href = "https://eventlink/">`

4. Modify height within the img tag. Width should always be 600 pixels so the EDM spans half of the screen when email is opened on desktop.
This can be easily calculated using https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/ratios.php .

The line should look like this
`<a href = "https://eventlink/"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/something.jpg" width=600 height=480><img></a>`
